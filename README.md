## The simplest helpdesk system to setup and use

Have you ever wondered a simple way to make your clients open support tickets and you track and show them?

This is the software that I think would help you.

### Setup

First of all, you'll need:
- DB Server - For free tier use PlanetScale with MySQL
- Frontend - Since we use react, Vercell is the way to go
- Backend - We developed the backend with Springboot, so, railway.app has a free tier
